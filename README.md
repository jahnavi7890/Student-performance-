# Student-performance-

This project aims in predicting the marks based on the previous scores performed in mathematics of student accordingly. It is affected through various factors such as Grade 1(G1), Grade 2(G2), study time, failures, school support(schoolsup), activities, and internet. Based on these features, we can predict Grade 3(G3) using linear regression. Other models such asrandom forest, SVM can also be used here. But due to the basic understanding, we use linear regression which is easy and simple to read the pattern.
